	abstract = {This paper gives an overview of OpenMC, an open source Monte Carlo particle transport code recently developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. OpenMC uses continuous-energy cross sections and a constructive solid geometry representation, enabling high-fidelity modeling of nuclear reactors and other systems. Modern, portable input/output file formats are used in OpenMC: XML for input, and HDF5 for output. High performance parallel algorithms in OpenMC have demonstrated near-linear scaling to over 100,000 processors on modern supercomputers. Other topics discussed in this paper include plotting, CMFD acceleration, variance reduction, eigenvalue calculations, and software development processes.},

	abstract = {A depletion solver has been implemented in OpenMC and is described herein. The depletion solver is implemented in Python and interfaces with OpenMC’s transport solver through a C++ application programming interface, which enables an in-memory transport-depletion coupling. Multiple integration methods for advancing in time have been implemented and exhibit tradeoffs in cost, accuracy, and memory use. For all time integration methods, evaluation of the matrix exponential is performed by using the incomplete partial fraction form of the Chebyshev rational approximation method.},

	abstract = {Modelling and simulation (M\&S) have gradually become irreplaceable tools in the field of Nuclear Science and Technology (NS\&T), including nuclear energy systems. This is partly due to growing computational resources and advances in computational science and partly to the difficulties to finance, build and license new experimental facilities. However, the utilization of M\&S for research and development (R\&D) and education and training (E\&T) applications is somewhat hampered by limited accessibility to controlled and sensitive nuclear M\&S tools as well as by the desires of the developers of these tools to retain their intellectual property (IP). Open-source software and open-access data are growingly perceived as means to accelerate innovation by promoting synergistic collaborative developments while lowering the barriers associated to code distribution, modification, and sharing. Open-source software development is ideal for R\&D and E\&T purposes because it permits the enhancement of understanding, the use of advanced computational methods and it promotes the cooperation among researchers and scientists, without rigorous constraints on quality assurance or reliance on proprietary data for technology-specific validation. As a fundamental research tool, this helps to mitigate constraints related to dual use of such technology. It is in this context that an initiative is being launched under the aegis of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to promote the development and application of open-source multi-physics simulation in support of R\&D and E\&T in NS\&T. This paper presents scope and objectives of this initiative.},
