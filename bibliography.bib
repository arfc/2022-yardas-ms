OpenMC uses continuous-energy cross sections and a constructive solid geometry representation, enabling high-fidelity modeling of nuclear reactors and other systems. Modern, portable input/output file formats are used in OpenMC: XML for input, and HDF5 for output. High performance parallel algorithms in OpenMC have demonstrated near-linear scaling to over 100,000 processors on modern supercomputers. Other topics discussed in this paper include plotting, CMFD acceleration, variance reduction, eigenvalue calculations, and software development processes.},

Multiple integration methods for advancing in time have been implemented and exhibit tradeoffs in cost, accuracy, and memory use. For all time integration methods, evaluation of the matrix exponential is performed by using the incomplete partial fraction form of the Chebyshev rational approximation method.},

	abstract = {Modelling and simulation (M\&S) have gradually become irreplaceable tools in the field of Nuclear Science and Technology (NS\&T), including nuclear energy systems. This is partly due to growing computational resources and advances in computational science and partly to the difficulties to finance, build and license new experimental facilities. However, the utilization of M\&S for research and development (R\&D) and education and training (E\&T) applications is somewhat hampered by limited accessibility to controlled and sensitive nuclear M\&S tools as well as by the desires of the developers of these tools to retain their intellectual property (IP). Open-source software and open-access data are growingly perceived as means to accelerate innovation by promoting synergistic collaborative developments while lowering the barriers associated to code distribution, modification, and sharing. Open-source software development is ideal for R\&D and E\&T purposes because it permits the enhancement of understanding, the use of advanced computational methods and it promotes the cooperation among researchers and scientists, without rigorous constraints on quality assurance or reliance on proprietary data for technology-specific validation. As a fundamental research tool, this helps to mitigate constraints related to dual use of such technology. It is in this context that an initiative is being launched under the aegis of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to promote the development and application of open-source multi-physics simulation in support of R\&D and E\&T in NS\&T. This paper presents scope and objectives of this initiative.},

	abstract = {The presence of radiatively active gases in the Earth's atmosphere (water vapor, carbon dioxide, and ozone) raises its global mean surface temperature by 30 K, making our planet habitable by life as we know it. There has been an increase in carbon dioxide and other trace gases since the Industrial Revolution, largely as a result of man's activities, increasing the radiative heating of the troposphere and surface by about 2 W m−2. This heating is likely to be enhanced by resulting changes in water vapor, snow and sea ice, and cloud. The associated equilibrium temperature rise is estimated to be between 1 and 2 K, there being uncertainties in the strength of climate feedbacks, particularly those due to cloud. The large thermal inertia of the oceans will slow the rate of warming, so that the expected temperature rise will be smaller than the equilibrium rise. This increases the uncertainty in the expected warming to date, with estimates ranging from less than 0.5 K to over 1 K. The observed increase of 0.5 K since 1900 is consistent with the lower range of these estimates, but the variability in the observed record is such that one cannot necessarily conclude that the observed temperature change is due to increases in trace gases. The prediction of changes in temperature over the next 50 years depends on assumptions concerning future changes in trace gas concentrations, the sensitivity of climate, and the effective thermal inertia of the oceans. On the basis of our current understanding a further warming of at least 1 K seems likely. Numerical models of climate indicate that the changes will not be uniform, nor will they be confined to temperature. The simulated warming is largest in high latitudes in winter and smallest over sea ice in summer, with little seasonal variation in the tropics. Annual mean precipitation and runoff increase in high latitudes, and most simulations indicate a drier land surface in northern mid-latitudes in summer. The agreement between different models is much better for temperature than for changes in the hydrological cycle. Priorities for future research include developing an improved representation of cloud in numerical models, obtaining a better understanding of vertical mixing in the deep ocean, and determining the inherent variability of the ocean-atmosphere system. Progress in these areas should enable detection of a man-made “greenhouse” warming within the next two decades.},

	abstract = {This report identifies underlying economic and electricity market factors that have led to early retirements of U.S. operating nuclear power plants, assesses the Gap between operating revenues and operating costs for selected nuclear power plants, and discusses a range of actions that might be taken to stop early retirement of operating nuclear power plants. The Kewaunee and Vermont Yankee nuclear power plants were retired early for economic and financial reasons. Early retirement has been announced or proposed for Clinton and Quad Cities in Illinois, Fitzpatrick and Ginna in New York, Fort Calhoun in Nebraska. Other nuclear power plants, including Palisades, Davis-Besse, Prairie Island, and Three Mile Island Unit 1, have been identified as facing financial stress that might lead to early retirement. The early retirement of operating nuclear power plants will mean the loss of a large amount of zero-emission electricity, inconsistent with the goal of reducing carbon emissions in the electricity sector. This report provides a high-level view of the major factors driving early retirement: • The U.S. market and private ownership approach to the electricity sector; • Low electricity market prices resulting from low natural gas prices, low demand growth, increased penetration of renewable generation, and negative electricity market prices; and • No compensation to nuclear power plants for public benefits including zero-emission electricity.},
