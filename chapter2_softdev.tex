A major component of this work was restructuring of the SaltProc code and implementation of OpenMC.

\section{OpenMC}%
\label{sec:openmc}

OpenMC \cite{romano_openmc_2015} is an open source Monte Carlo particle transport code. The \Gls{crpg} at \Gls{mit} started developing OpenMC back in 2011 with a focus on scalability for exascale computing. Since that time, developers new and old contributed features (cite?) and fixes to the tool expanding its scope and use cases. Notable features of OpenMC (as of version 0.12.1) are as follows \cite{openmc_homepage}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Support for fixed source, $k$-eigenvalue, and subcritical neutron multiplication cacluclations.
    \item Support for \Gls{csg} and \Gls{cad} geometry.
    \item Support for both continuous and multigroup transport calculations.
    \item Support for parallel execution via MPI and OpenMP.
    \item Geometry visualization through the Python API.
\end{itemize}
The tool is now quite mature and feature-rich, rivaling its closed-source export controlled counterparts. 


Recently, depletion and photon transport were added by (who?)... The new depletion feature enables us to couple OpenMC to SaltProc and a fully open-source stack.
