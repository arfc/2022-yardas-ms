# ms-thesis-template
This repo holds the template for UIUC master's thesis. 
When you use this repository as a template, please name your repository
something specific like `bae-ms-thesis` rather than something 
generic like `ms-thesis`. While you will only have one MS thesis,
the group will have dozens or hundreds over time.
