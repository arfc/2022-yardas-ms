\section{Motivation}%
\label{sec:motivation}

(if this isn't helping, delete it all and then try to rewrite it)
 - global warming is a result of anthropocentric climate change
 -> increase in industrial activity, heavy reliance on electricity
 -> assert: nuclear power can do one of two things
    1. Current tech -> replace large nat-gas power stations 
    2. "new" nuclear -> relpace smaller power stations + expand scope
        of nuclear power to more specialized use cases (space, remote communities, etc)
-> six gen4 reactors -> molten salt reactor one of these
-> NRC liscening approach for advacned reactors will be based on current R&D, specifcially M&S
-> M&S tools that answer all relevant licesning questions for msr specifically do not exist
-> SaltProc aims to be a tool that can answer some of these questions, as well as a general purpose
    research tool for simulating MSRs

\section{Objectives}%
\label{sec:objectives}

 free and open source software provides lowest barrier of entry
 - saltproc built for use with serpent which defeats the purpose of being
    FOSS
 - Code needs to be restructured to enable easier development of interfaces to 
 open source MC transport codes
 - We then need to implement the necessary machinery to interface with a specific
    open source MC transport code (OpenMC)
 - Once implemented, we need to validate with a serpent-based case
